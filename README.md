# Grad-bot-UI-Chat-application

This project is an attempt to aid all the graduate students or anyone for that matter who seeks to take addmission in a university.
It pulls live twitter feeds of subscribed topics and displays them in its own chat. Besides this you can also group/one-one chat
with people on this app. Behind the scenes it uses Apache Kafka as a middleware to implement the pub-sub model.

<h2> What is Apache Kafka?</h2>
Apache kafka is an open source platform used for streamlining applications with large streams of data. It essentially serves as a
middleware queue, that takes in events from various processes or groups of processes and serves it out to specific processes or groups.
It is pivotal in the use of publisher-subsciber models. To know more about Apache Kafka visit <a href="https://www.confluent.io/what-is-apache-kafka/">
